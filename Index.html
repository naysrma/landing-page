            <span class="span">Ratan Naval Tata</span> (born 28 December 1937)
            is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist and former chairman of
            Tata Sons. He was a chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012,
            and interim chairman from October 2016 through February 2017. He
            continues to head its charitable trusts.[2][3] In 2008, he received
            the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India,
            after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour
            in 2000. <br />
            He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of
            Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from the
            Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree
            in architecture.[5] He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the
            shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as
            chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under
            his tenure the Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and
            Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group
            into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest
            philanthropists in the world, having donated around 60–65% of his
            income to charity.

          <h2 class="heading02">Career</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            In the 1970s Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group.
            He achieved initial success by turning the subsidiary National Radio
            and Electronics (NELCO) around, only to see it collapse during an
            economic slowdown.[15][16] In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as
            chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. Initially, Tata
            faced stiff resistance from the heads of various subsidiaries, who
            had a large amount of operational freedom under the senior Tata's
            tenure. In response, Tata implemented a number of policies designed
            to consolidate power, including the implementation of a retirement
            age, having subsidiaries report directly to the group office, and
            requiring subsidiaries to contribute their profit to building the
            Tata group brand.Tata prioritised innovation and delegated many
            responsibilities to younger talent.[17] Under his leadership,
            overlapping operations between subsidiaries were streamlined into
            company-wide operations, with the group exiting unrelated businesses
            to take on globalisation.[18] Ratan Tata (right) in Bangladesh, 2005
            During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40
            times, and profit over 50 times.
